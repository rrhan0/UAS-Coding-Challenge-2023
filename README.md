# UAS-Coding-Challenge-2023

Overview
Richard Han's submission. Includes a Django server using the Django Rest Framework (DRF) for creating a RESTful API with a simple React frontend. Field and button allows user to connect and disconnect from the drone.

May not work with python 3.10, had to change collections.MutableMapping -> collections.abc.MutableMapping in dronekit/__init__.py

I could not get the tests to work due, probably due to issues with my project setting/configuration. Ran out of time because I was sick.

Includes requirements.txt
